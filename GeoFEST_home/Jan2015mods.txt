* add new attributes to info->buoy structure; little_g and grav_out_flag
  Latter will control whether to compute gravity changes for a particular buoyancy interface
  There will be numbuoy of these 1 or 0 flags, read in along with delta_rho values
  definition: DONE   read-in: DONE
  
* I'm also thinking it will be appropriate here to read in an interface value of little_g
  to use for the delta_g calculation.  Looking to retire the inelegant material-based little_g
  and big_G currently used
  DONE
  
* Only allocate dgrav storage if grav_out_flag is true -DONE-
  and also abort calc loop if it is not true -DONE-

* BIG_G now defined universally in finel.h; requires recompile to change value
  (consider changing this at some point?)  Need to properly refer to BIG_G everywhere
  DONE

* Need to properly obtain little_g in new location for delta_g calculation
  DONE
  
* New format for gravin file:

numat lines containing density (only)
-followed by-
numbuoy lines each containing delta_rho, little_g, and grav_out_flag for each interface

* global.displ is used to compute grav changes, so subsequent time step evaluations
  should yield the full accumulated changes to that time.  ***IMPORTANT*** Need to
  change from del_displ to displ in dgrav_flux() since it is inconsistent currently
  with dgrav_form()!
  DONE
  
* remove grav output request from elastic() and simply place it inside output_phase().
  This will cause a grav output at any time a regular output is requested.
  DONE
