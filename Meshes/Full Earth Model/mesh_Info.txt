Information regarding what the various saved elements 
(Boundary Conditions) in CUBIT correspond to on the mesh. 

Block 1: Mantle  (1.450e+11	1.450e+11	1.000e+21   	1.000000e+00	0.00  0.00  0.00)
Block 2: Crust  (6.700e+10	6.700e+10	0.000000e+00	1.000000e+00	0.00  0.00  0.00)


Sideset 1: Arbitrary choice (was used for surface forces, which is set to zero in the
	   spherical Earth model)
Sideset 2: Core-Mantle Boundary (Buoyancy: 5.0e+4)
Sideset 3: Mantle-Crust Boundary (Buoyancy: 1.96e+2)
Sideset 4: Crust-Air Boundary  (Buoyancy: 3.293e+4)

Nodeset 1: Fixed in x (3 points at the bottom of the half sphere)
Nodeset 2: Fixed in y (3 points at the bottom of the half-sphere)
Nodeset 3: Fixed in z (3 points at the bottom of the half-sphere)
Nodeset 4: Identified nodes to Plot Data in output .png files using matplotlib
	   Not used in the spherical model configuration
	   (3 points at the bottom of the half-sphere were chosen)
Nodeset 5: Split Nodes (The Fault Plane) 

Slip-Parameters:
	Slip Magnitude: 10m 
	B-Vector: 1 0 0 
	S-Vector: x = 0 y = -0.970296 z = 0.241922


GeoFEST Tweaks:
Be sure to set surface forces to zero in eldata.dat
Number of Split Nodes needs to be set in eldata.dat?
